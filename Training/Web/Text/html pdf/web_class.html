Markup languages are designed for the processing, definition and presentation of text. The language specifies code for formatting, both the layout and style, within a text file. The code used to specify the formatting are called tags. HTML, Extensible-HTML, XML, SGML, etc are examples of a widely known and used markup language.

Scripting Langauges are high-level programming language that is interpreted by another program at runtime rather than compiled by the computer's processor as other programming languages (such as C and C++) are. Scripting languages, which can be embedded within HTML, commonly are used to add functionality to a Web page, such as different menu styles or graphic displays or to serve dynamic advertisements. These types of languages are client-side scripting languages, affecting the data that the end user sees in a browser window. Other scripting languages are server-side scripting languages that manipulate the data, usually in a database, on the server.

They came about largely because of the development of the Internet as a communications tool. JavaScript, ASP, JSP, PHP, Perl, Tcl and Python are examples of scripting languages.



HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
    HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
    HTML describes the structure of Web pages using markup
    HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages
    HTML elements are represented by tags
    HTML tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on
    Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page

 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html> 

    The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines this document to be HTML5
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.
It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.
    The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
    The <head> element contains meta information about the document
    The <title> element specifies a title for the document
    The <body> element contains the visible page content
    The <h1> element defines a large heading
    The <p> element defines a paragraph


HTML Tags

HTML tags are element names surrounded by angle brackets:

<tagname>content goes here...</tagname>

    HTML tags normally come in pairs like <p> and </p>
    The first tag in a pair is the start tag, the second tag is the end tag
    The end tag is written like the start tag, but with a forward slash inserted before the tag name

Tip: The start tag is also called the opening tag, and the end tag the closing tag.
HTML Links
HTML links are defined with the <a> tag:
Example <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a> 
HTML Images

HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.
The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes:
Example <img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142"> 
Empty HTML Elements
HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.
<br> is an empty element without a closing tag (the <br> tag defines a line break).
Empty elements can be "closed" in the opening tag like this: <br />.
