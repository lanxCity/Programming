              &OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;Before joining the bootcamp, I've never
              written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals
              who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged
              to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful
              things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not
              disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long
              for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
              outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that
              no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it
              during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It
              certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after
              receiving multiple offers. 100%
