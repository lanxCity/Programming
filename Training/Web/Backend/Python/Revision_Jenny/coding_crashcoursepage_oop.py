# ===> Higher order function
# Higher-Order Functions: These are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions.
# Decorators: A specific type of higher-order function used to modify the behavior of another function.
# In Python, decorators are often used with the @decorator syntax for simplicity and readability.

# ===> Decorator
# A function decorator in Python is a higher-order function that takes another function
# as an argument and returns a new function. Decorators are a powerful feature of Python
# that allows you to modify or extend the behavior of functions or methods without directly
# modifying their source code. They are commonly used for tasks such as logging, caching,
# authentication, and more.
# For example, imagine we have an existing function or module and there's to be some modifications
# before final result and there's no way to modify the module or decided to leave the original code
# as it is, then we can make use of decorator.

data = list(range(-5, 10))

# we can use the existing "sum" function
print(sum(range(10)))
print(sum(data))

# ---------------- NB: "@non_neg_sum" is a shorthand for "miniSum = non_neg_sum(miniSum)"
# "miniSum = non_neg_sum(miniSum)" is equivalent to "summation = non_neg_sum(sum)"
# where the variable "minSum" stores the returned function "sum_wrapper" of the higher order function

miniSum(data)


# Instead of calling the decorator "non_neg_sum" function, we can call the function name directly

# ===> Modules (custom modules or external files in the main code)
import test_modules

# from test_modules import add, subtract, divide, multiply
# from test_modules import *  # To import all functions in the module


# ==> Special variable (__name__) and methods (__init__)
# In C programming for example, "main" function is the starting point of execution or entry point
# And same goes for python as well where we have the main module or file that interact with other modules
# E.g. this file is the main module or file because it is not used in another program

# =====> Python OOP
# Class is the design of an object
# Class -> Design/Blueprint
# Object -> Instance of the class; Object created from a class is called an instance of a class
# So we can use the term object/instance to mean the same thing.
# A class object has two types of information termed as "Attributes" of the obj.
# Data attr (also known as obj ppties) defines the state of an obj
# Function attr (also known as methods) defines the behaviour of an obj

# I. ----> Class and Object
class Person:
    def walk(self):
        print('I am walking')


person1 = Person()
person2 = Person()

# To access the object methods, we call the method on the class... OR
Person.walk(person1)  # Pass the obj as args to rep the "self" param
Person.walk(person2)

# Call the methods on the object itself (which is the conventional way)
# but under the hood, the first method is what is happening
person1.walk()
person2.walk()


# ===> Types of attributes/variables in oop realm
# Two types -> Instance attributes and class (static) attributes
# variable outside the constructor "__init__" is a class variable and it is the same for all objects of the class
class Car:
    # Class attr
    # It can be access directly through the class name or instance but
    # modification must be from class itself except if an obj wants to override it
    car_wheel = 4
    def __init__(self, model, colour, milage):
        # Object attributes
        self.model = model
        self.colour = colour
        self.milage = milage

    def update(self, colour):
        self.colour = colour


car1 = Car('BMW', 'Black', 20)
car2 = Car('Lexus', 'Pink', 10)

# car1.car_wheel = 6  # New attr has been added to this obj and overriding the class attr
# print(car1.model, car1.car_wheel)
# print(car2.model, car2.car_wheel)
# print(Car.car_wheel)

#----------------
# Car.car_wheel = 6
# print(car1.model, car1.car_wheel)
# print(car2.model, car2.car_wheel)
# print(Car.car_wheel)




# ===> Types of methods
# Instance, class, and static methods
# a. Instance method -> It is used to work with instance attr and it can be either
# Accessor/getter (to fetch attr value) and Mutator/setter (to modify attr value) methods

# b. Class method is used for class attributes and/or to manipulate the whole class
# c. Static methods are utility methods for miscellaneous purposes and it is called on class name
# we use the decorator "@staticmethod" for such... it is just there as usual function for some operation
class Student:
    department = 'Agricultural and Environmental Engineering'

# ===> Inheritance
# This is a concept that allows a class
# (called a subclass or derived class) to
# inherit attributes and methods from another
# class (called a superclass or base class)
# Diff methods of inheritance:
# Single inheritance -> A subclass inherits from a single superclass
# Multilevel inheritance -> A subclass inherits from another subclass, creating a chain of inheritance.
# Multiple inheritance -> A subclass can inherit from more than one superclass
# Hierarchical inheritance -> Multiple subclasses inherit from a single superclass.


# 1. Single inheritance
class A:
    def method1(self):
        print('method1 -> in class A')

    def method2(self):
        print('method2 -> in class A')
class B(A):
    def method3(self):
        print('method3 -> in class A')

    def method4(self):
        print('method4 -> in class A')



# 2. Multilevel inheritance
class A:
    def method1(self):
        print('method1 -> in class A')

    def method2(self):
        print('method2 -> in class A')
class B(A):
    def method1(self):
        print('method1 -> in class B')
    def method3(self):
        print('method3 -> in class B')

    def method4(self):
        print('method4 -> in class B')
class C(B):
    def method5(self):
        print('method5 -> in class C')
