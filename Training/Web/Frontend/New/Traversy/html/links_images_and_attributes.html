    <!-- A. Creating links
        -- Internal And External links
        -- To create a link, "anchor / <a>" tag is used
        
        -> Internal links are links created to navigate pages within the site. These pages can be linked together through "Relative and Absolute" pathnames

        -- > Relative pathnames point to files based on their locations relative to the current file location.
        e.g.
        - href="about.html" -> the about file is located in the current directory as this file.

        - href="contactFolder/contact.html" -> the contact.html is located in the directory "contactFolder", which is located in the current directory

        - href="../about.html" -> the about.html is located in the directory one level up from the currernt directory (the parent directory)

        - href="../../contactFolder/contact.html" -> the contact.html is located two directory level up from the currernt directory, in a folder contactFolder

        -- > Absolute pathnames point to the page by starting at the top level of your directory hierarchy and working downward through all the
        intervening directories to reach the file. Absolute pathnames always begin with a slash, "/" which is the way theyâ€™re differentiated from relative pathnames. Following the slash are all directories in the path from the top level or document root to the file you are linking.

        - Unlike relative pathnames, href="/about.html" points to the topmost folder we are working in; the current "workspace" on the VS code which is "Frontend" folder. This is the root folder or workspace folder of the current file.
    
        -- > External links are Links to other websites from one's page. e.g. href="http://google.com"
